# Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR)

Open-domain question answering relies on efficient passage retrieval to select candidate contexts. Although reducing open-domain QA to machine reading is a very reasonable strategy, a huge performance degradation is often observed in practice, indicating the needs of improving retrieval. The retrieval can be practically implemented using dense representations alone, where embeddings are learned from a small number of questions and passages by a simple dual-encoder framework.
